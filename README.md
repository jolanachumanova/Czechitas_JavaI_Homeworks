## Java I course
Course for almost complete beginners. I’ve learned basics of Object Oriented Programming, basics on how to code in Java and create miniapp with Swing library. We were working with Java 8 and in IntelliJ IDEA.

## homework1_bank
Assignment for working with constructors. The code is mostly in Czech, that’s how our lecturer wanted it, sorry about that.
It’s a very simple simulation of creating a bank account with some conditions in the constructors.

## homework2_farmer
The task was to create simple calculator miniapp for farmers with chickens and rabbits with Swing library. I’ve implemented exceptions successfully. The app can calculate how much food the animals will consume over the course of winter and how many rows of vegetables and grain will be needed to feed them. The code is in English, finally.

## homework3_paint_editor
More complex miniapp in Swing. It’s a relaxation app that can fill in colors in black and white pictures. Main task was to delve into more complex functions of Swing. The code is in Czech.
